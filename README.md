# Sociopulse

## Work
This project was built for creating a sentiment analysis of society based on Twitter's tweets on the topics of COVID-19 and lockdown. We have created insightful charts, tables and other visualizations to understand and build an emotion tracker which could help government/social bodies receive a quick feedback on what the community's opinions are on various policies or topics. 

We have used tools like Python,Tweepy,Tableau, R Studio and Google Colab and we have worked on concepts like NLP modelling, data visualization, data analysis and so on.

This project was built for #BuildwithAI Global Hack 2020
